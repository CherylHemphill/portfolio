      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
      I am a full stack developer with a strong inclination towards backend technologies. My journey into the world of coding began when I enrolled in the University of Austin's comprehensive full stack bootcamp. Guided by experienced instructors and immersive hands-on projects, I honed my skills in both front-end and back-end development. While I'm comfortable working on all aspects of web development, my heart lies in crafting robust and efficient server-side solutions. I thrive on tackling complex challenges and architecting the backbone of applications that power seamless user experiences. With a solid foundation in modern web technologies and a curious mind that's always eager to learn, I'm dedicated to creating innovative and scalable solutions that make a meaningful impact.
